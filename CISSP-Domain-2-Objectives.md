[Domain 2](#domain2-top) **Asset Security**

[2.1](#2.1) Identify and classify information assets

The Asset Security domain focuses on collecting, handling, and protecting information throughout its lifecycle. A primary step is classifying information based on its value to the organization.

Data Classification
- Managing the data lifecycle refers to protecting it from cradle to the grave; steps need to be taken to protect the data when its first created until it is destroyed.
- One of the first steps in the lifecycle is identifying and classifying information and assets, often within a security policy
- In this context, assets include sensitive data, the hardware used to process it, and the media used to hold it
- Sensitive data is any information that isn't public or unclassified
- It can include confidential, proprietary, protected (etc) types of data that an organization needs to protect due to its value, or to comply with existing laws and regulations
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (NIST SP 800-122 provides formal definitions), and Protected Health Information (PHI) are two important types to protect
- Proprietary data refers to any data that helps an organization maintain a competitive edge
- Organizations classify data using labels
  - government classification labels include Top Secret, Secret, Confidential and Unclassified
  - non-government organizations use labels such as Confidential/Proprietary, Private, Sensitive, and Public
  - labels can be as granular and custom as required by the organization
  - remember that "sensitive information" typically refers to any info that isn't public or unclassified
-  It is important to protect data in all states: at rest, in transit, or in use
-  The best way to protect data confidentiality is via use of strong encryption

Asset Classification
- It's important to identify and classify assets, such as computers, mobile devices etc.
- Asset classifications should match data classification - i.e. if a computer is processing top secret data, the computer should be classified as a top secret asset
- Clearance relates to access to certain classfication of data or equipment, and who has access to that level or classification
- A formal approval process should be used to user access changes.
  - before a user is granted access they should be educated on working with that level of classification
- Classification levels can be used by businesses during acquisitions, ensuring only personnel who need to know are involved in the assessment or transition
  
In general, classification labels help users use data and assets properly, for instance by restricting dissemination or use of assets by their classification.
